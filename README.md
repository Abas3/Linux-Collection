# Linux Collection
		##### This is a work in progess
		Here lies some of my configurations (dotfile) and scripts I made that I think are useful

### Directory Structure
		Scripts - Located in script folder.. lul
		Res - Mainly dotfiles and directorys for .config

### Useful Working Scripts
		update.sh - You have the option to back up your date files, located in your home
				directory or restore the files inside of the res folder to your home directory.

		cleansetup.sh - Wouldn't encourage use as of now. Will eventually automate the 
				setup of a clean arch install. Mainly haven't finished because I keep breaking
				my own install.
